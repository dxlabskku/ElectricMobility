This repository contains data for the paper "The impact of consumers’ sustainable electronic word-of-mouth in purchasing sustainable mobility: An analysis from online review comments of e-commerce".

## Overview
The traditional transport sector is under pressure to change its structure to be more sustainable and eco-friendly in light of the rising global issues regarding environmental pollution and climate change. However, the concept of sustainable mobility, one of the main streams for improving the sustainability of the sector, is still in its infancy in our society. Thus, this study aims to examine consumer purchasing behaviors of sustainable mobility through their opinions regarding online platforms. The analysis of the 27,025 review comments in the dataset revealed two important factors of peripheral routes that significantly influence users' purchasing behavior: rating scores and the number of review comments. However, there are indirect effects of their overall sentimental scores and opinions with sustainable attributes about behavior. Based on the findings of this study, several academic implications, as well as practical cornerstones, are examined.
